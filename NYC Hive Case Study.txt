3. You might have encountered unusual or erroneous rows in the data set. Can you conclude which vendor is doing a bad job in providing the records using different columns of the data set? Summarize your conclusions based on every column where these errors are present. 
For example, There are unusual passenger count, i.e. 0 which is unusual 



--After analyzing and checking the column definition in datasheet, found following issues.

--Vendor 2 has provided the faulty data for following columns. 
--Total Amount
--Tolls Amount 
--Improvement Surcharge 
--Tip Amount 
--MTA Tax
--Fare Amount
--Pickup Time 
--Dropoff Time


--Vendor 1 also provided some faulty data for following columns 
--Passenger Count 
--Rate Code ID 


--For column "Extra" and "Trip Distance", both vendors provided faulty data.

--From all the analysis and observations, we can say that Vendor 2 is doing a bad job while providing the records.

--Before answering the below questions, you need to create a clean, ORC partitioned table for analysis. Remove all the erroneous row

--From the data description :

--Data is provided for the Months November and December. We can partition the data on Months.
--Since data is for 2017 only, no need to partition on Year.
--Next partition can be done on vendor ID as there are 2 Vendors to speed up the query speed.
